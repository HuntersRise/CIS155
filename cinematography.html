            <h2>Eschewing the Volume: A Return to Old-School Techniques</h2>
            <p>Unlike many modern Star Wars productions, Andor chose to forgo the use of the Volume, or StageCraft technology, in favor of practical sets and on-location shooting with CGI scene extensions, creating a more realistic world.</p>

            <h2>Groundbreaking Cinematography: Perspective and Immersion</h2>
            <p>The cinematography of Andor stands out for its use of grounded, character-centric angles. Most scenes are framed from the character’s perspective, starting at their feet or head, then subtly moving or holding still, pulling the viewer directly into their world. This approach immerses the audience in the narrative, giving a visceral sense of the characters’ experiences and surroundings.</p>

            <h2>Filming Locations and Set Design: A Tangible World</h2>
            <p>Filmed across breathtaking real-world locations and meticulously crafted sets, Andor achieves a sense of authenticity rarely seen in modern productions. CGI is employed sparingly, used only to extend or enhance scenes, while the physical environments anchor the story in a tangible reality. This fusion of practical and digital design brings the Star Wars universe to life in a grounded and visually stunning way.</p>

            <h2>Eschewing the Volume: A Return to Old-School Techniques</h2>
            <p>Unlike many modern Star Wars productions, Andor chose to forgo the use of the Volume, or StageCraft technology, in favor of practical sets and location shooting. The Volume, known for its immersive digital environments, was a staple of series like The Mandalorian and Obi-Wan Kenobi. However, Andor’s production team prioritized realism and tangibility, building massive sets at Pinewood Studios and filming on-location across the UK and beyond.</p>

            <h2>Realism Through Practical Sets and Locations</h2>
            <p>Showrunner Tony Gilroy described the approach as “old-school,” focusing on real environments to anchor the story’s gritty tone. Actor Diego Luna praised this decision, highlighting the immersive experience of working within physical locations and elaborate sets. This dedication to authenticity resulted in a distinctive visual style, setting Andor apart from other Star Wars series.</p>

            <h2>The Craft of Set Design: Building a Tangible Galaxy</h2>
            <p>At Pinewood Studios, the production team constructed intricate, large-scale sets that served as the backbone for Andor’s immersive world. Production designer Sanne Wohlenberg, known for her work on Chernobyl, played a pivotal role in crafting these environments. Her focus on detail ensured that every scene felt grounded, with CGI used sparingly to enhance, not replace, the practical foundations.</p>

            <h2>Remote Filming: Capturing a Living World</h2>
            <p>Filming on-location brought unique challenges and rewards. The team traveled to remote sites to capture natural landscapes that enriched the story’s visual narrative. From mountainous terrains to bustling urban centers, each setting added depth and texture to the galaxy. These real-world locations created a backdrop that felt as alive as the characters inhabiting it.</p>

      <h1>Why You Should Watch Andor</h1>

          <h2>What I Will be Focusing On</h2>
          <p>With the release of Andor Starwars projects under Tony Gilroy's influence have a bright new future. In this website I'll be focusing on the craftmanship that elevates this show to a new level of storytelling in the starwars universe after first discussing why the other shows did not bring satisfaction to fans and why Tony Gilroy's involvement means that Starwars may be entering a new age.</p>

          <h2>Star Wars: The Franchise Exhaustion Era</h2>
          <p>In recent years, some fans have felt overwhelmed by the volume of Star Wars content, often describing it as the "Franchise Exhaustion Era." This period saw a rapid expansion of stories, series, and movies, many of which leaned heavily on nostalgia and well-known characters. But now, Andor marks the beginning of something different. It shows a careful and thoughtful mind at work as every scene is beautifully done, and the character writing feels logical and real.</p>

        <div class="text-content">
          <h2>A Departure from Fan Service</h2>
          <p>Andor is refreshing in its use of fan service—or, more accurately, its lack thereof. While recent Star Wars shows often relied on cameos and callbacks, Andor emphasizes character-driven storytelling and new perspectives. It steers away from the cyclical nature of "self-referentiality" that has come to define many recent Star Wars entries (see the image on the left for an example from the recent boba fett show, two characters that realistically should never have crossed paths).</p>

          <h2>Craft and Cinematic Quality in Andor</h2>
          <p>One of the standout features of Andor is its craftsmanship. Where recent Star Wars series often felt fake and broken, due to character writing and over-reliance on the volume (a new cinimatic tool created for The Mandalorian) Andor felt amazing and new, given that it did not use the volume even once in the 12 episodes of runtime.</p>

        <h2>Crafting a Unique Star Wars Vision</h2>
        <p>While revolutionary, over-reliance on technology like the Volume can hinder immersion. <b>Andor’s</b> commitment to shooting on location and using practical sets, with CGI as enhancement, creates a grounded, breathtakingly authentic visual experience. When blending CGI and practical effects you can get this amazing quality, which requires an open mind and clear directive and narritive forsight.</p></div>

        <p>Beyond Star Wars, Tony Gilroy remains a respected Hollywood figure, known for thought-provoking and layered stories. His narritive and directive foresight is imparitive for the direction he gives to each of his shows and his steadfast approach to creating some of the best cinima to ever grace our screens.</p>

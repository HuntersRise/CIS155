            <h2>Welcome to the Andor Era</h2>
            <p>With the release of Andor, Star Wars has entered a new chapter. Andor has been described as a pivotal point in Star Wars history—a shift away from recent franchise trends and a bold step into more nuanced storytelling. Join us as we dive into how Andor redefines Star Wars.</p>

            <h2>Star Wars: The Franchise Exhaustion Era</h2>
            <p>In recent years, some fans have felt overwhelmed by the volume of Star Wars content, often describing it as the "Franchise Exhaustion Era." This period saw a rapid expansion of stories, series, and movies, many of which leaned heavily on nostalgia and well-known characters. But now, Andor marks the beginning of something different.</p>

            <h2>A Departure from Fan Service</h2>
            <p>Andor is refreshing in its use of fan service—or, more accurately, its lack thereof. While recent Star Wars shows often relied on cameos and callbacks, Andor emphasizes character-driven storytelling and new perspectives. It steers away from the cyclical nature of "self-referentiality" that has come to define many recent Star Wars entries (see the image on the left for an example from the recent boba fett show).</p>

            <h2>Craft and Cinematic Quality in Andor</h2>
            <p>One of the standout features of Andor is its craftsmanship. Where recent Star Wars series often felt episodic and cameo-driven, Andor brings back the cinematic quality and artistry that made the original Star Wars films iconic. Through masterful direction and compelling visual storytelling, Andor reclaims the high standards fans expect from Star Wars.</p>
